      <div class="description text"><p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
      <p>Thank you to  on behalf of the Beef Checkoff for sponsoring this garlic butter steak recipe. I received compensation, but all opinions are my own.</p>

    <h4 class="howtocook"><p>How to Pan Sear Steaks:</p></h4>
      <ol class="howtocook list">
        <li>Pat dry - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Season generously - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li>Add butter and aromatics - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
      </ol>

    <p><strong class="protip">Pro Tip:</strong> We prefer using a large cast-iron pan for best heat conduction, but a large heavy stainless steel pan will also work.</p>
