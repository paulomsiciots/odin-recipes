        <h3>Ingredients in banana oatmeal pancakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bananas: super ripe bananas give the pancakes their natural sweetness. Make sure they have lots of brown spots!</li>
                <li>Eggs: you’ll need 2 eggs in this pancake recipe.</li>
                <li>Milk: add moisture with any milk you’d like. I typically use unsweetened almond milk.</li>
                <li>Oats: instead of using regular flour, these healthy banana pancakes are made with rolled oats! Feel free to use gluten free rolled oats.</li>
                <li>PPancake staples: you’ll also need baking powder to allow the pancakes to get nice and fluffy, plus some cinnamon, vanilla extract & salt for flavor. Learn how to make your own vanilla here!</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h3>Making the pancakes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend the ingredients. Yes, you’ll literally add all of the ingredients to a blender, and blend on high until smooth!</li>
                <li>Let batter sit. You’ll then want to let the batter sit in your blender for about 2 minutes while you heat up your pan.</li>
                <li>Cook & flip. Add olive oil or coconut oil to a griddle or large nonstick pan and place over medium heat. Add pancake batter 1/3 cup at a time and cook for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and tiny bubbles appear around the edges. Flip and cook 2 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Serve & devour. Serve pancakes with fresh fruit and a drizzle of pure maple syrup if you’d like!</li>
            </ol>
